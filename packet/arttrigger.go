// ArtTriggerPacket contains an ArtTrigger Packet.
//
// The ArtTrigger packet is used to send trigger macros to the network. The most common
// implementation involves a single controller broadcasting to all other devices.
// In some circumstances a controller may only wish to trigger a single device or a small
// group in which case unicast would be used
//
// The Key is an 8-bit number which defines the purpose of the packet. The interpretation
// of this field is dependent upon the Oem field. If the Oem field is set to a value other than
// 0xffff then the Key and SubKey fields are manufacturer specific
//
// The SubKey is an 8-bit number. The interpretation of this field is dependent upon the Oem field.
// If the Oem field is set to a value other than 0xffff then the Key and SubKey fields are
// manufacturer specific.
//
// The Payload is a fixed length array of 512, 8-bit bytes. The interpretation of this field is
// dependent upon the Oem field. If the Oem field is set to a value other than 0xffff then
// the Payload is manufacturer specific.
//
// However, when the Oem field = 0xffff the meaning of the Key, SubKey and Payload is:
//
// Key - Name     - SubKey:
//
//	0 - KeyAscii - The SubKey field contains an ASCII character which the receiving device should
//	               process as if it were a keyboard press. (Payload not used).
//	1 - KeyMacro - The SubKey field contains the number of a Macro which the receiving device
//	               should execute. (Payload not used).
//	2 - KeySoft  - The SubKey field contains a soft-key number which the receiving device should
//	               process as if it were a soft-key keyboard press. (Payload not used).
//	3 - KeyShow  - The SubKey field contains the number of a Show which the receiving device
//	               should run. (Payload not used).
//	4 - - 255      Undefined
//
// Packet Strategy:
//
//	Controller -  Receive:            Application Specific
//	              Unicast Transmit:   Application Specific
//	              Broadcast Transmit: Application Specific
//	Node -        Receive:            Application Specific
//	              Unicast Transmit:   Application Specific
//	              Broadcast Transmit: Application Specific
//	MediaServer - Receive:            Application Specific
//	              Unicast Transmit:   Application Specific
//	              Broadcast Transmit: Application Specific
