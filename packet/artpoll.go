// ArtPollPacket contains an ArtPoll Packet.
//
// The ArtPoll packet is used to discover the presence of other Controllers, Nodes and Media Servers.
// The ArtPoll packet is only sent by a Controller. Both Controllers and Nodes respond to the packet.
//
// A Controller broadcasts an ArtPoll packet to IP address 2.255.255.255 (sub-net mask 255.0.0.0) at
// UDP port 0x1936, this is the Directed Broadcast address.
//
// The Controller may assume a maximum timeout of 3 seconds between sending ArtPoll and receiving all
// ArtPollReply packets. If the Controller does not receive a response in this time it should consider
// the Node to have disconnected.
//
// The Controller that broadcasts an ArtPoll should also reply to its own message (to
// Directed Broadcast address) with an ArtPollReply. This ensures that any other Controllers listening
// to the network will detect all devices without the need for all Controllers connected to the
// network to send ArtPoll packets. It is a requirement of Art-Net that all controllers broadcast
// an ArtPoll every 2.5 to 3 seconds. This ensures that any network devices can easily detect a
// disconnect.
//
// Packet Strategy:
//
//	Controller -  Receive:            Send ArtPollReply
//	              Unicast Transmit:   Not Allowed
//	              Broadcast Transmit: Controller broadcasts this packet to poll all Controllers and
//	                                 Nodes on the network
//	Node -        Receive:            Send ArtPollReply
//	              Unicast Transmit:   Not Allowed
//	              Broadcast Transmit: Not Allowed
//	MediaServer - Receive:            Send ArtPollReply
//	              Unicast Transmit:   Not Allowed
//	              Broadcast Transmit: Not Allowed
