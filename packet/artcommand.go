// ArtCommandPacket contains an ArtCommand Packet.
//
// The ArtCommand packet is used to send property set style commands. The packet can be
// unicast or broadcast, the decision being application specific.
//
// The Data field contains the command text. The text is ASCII encoded and is null terminated
// and is case insensitive. It is legal, although inefficient, to set the Data array size to
// the maximum of 512 and null pad unused entries.
// The command text may contain multiple commands and adheres to the following syntax:
//
//	Command=Data&
//
// The ampersand is a break between commands. Also note that the text is capitalised for
// readability; it is case insensitive. Thus far, two commands are defined by Art-Net. It is
// anticipated that additional commands will be added as other manufacturers register commands
// which have industry wide relevance. These commands shall be transmitted with EstaMan = 0xFFFF.
//
// SwoutText - This command is used to re-programme the label associated with the
//
//	ArtPollReply->Swout fields. Syntax: "SwoutText=Playback&"
//
// SwinText  - This command is used to re-programme the label associated with the
//
//	ArtPollReply->Swin fields. Syntax: "SwinText=Record&"
//
// Packet Strategy:
//
//	Controller -  Receive:            Application Specific
//	              Unicast Transmit:   Application Specific
//	              Broadcast Transmit: Application Specific
//	Node -        Receive:            Application Specific
//	              Unicast Transmit:   Application Specific
//	              Broadcast Transmit: Application Specific
//	MediaServer - Receive:            Application Specific
//	              Unicast Transmit:   Application Specific
//	              Broadcast Transmit: Application Specific
