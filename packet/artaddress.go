// ArtAddressPacket contains an ArtAddress Packet.
//
// A Controller or monitoring device on the network can reprogram numerous controls of a
// node remotely. This, for example, would allow the lighting console to re-route DMX512
// data at remote locations. This is achieved by sending an ArtAddress packet to the Nodeâ€™s
// IP address. (The IP address is returned in the ArtPoll packet). The node replies with an
// ArtPollReply packet.
// Fields 5 to 13 contain the data that will be programmed into the node
//
// Packet Strategy:
//
//	Controller -  Receive:            No Action
//	              Unicast Transmit:   Controller transmits to a specific node IP address
//	              Broadcast Transmit: Not Allowed
//	Node -        Receive:            Reply by broadcasting ArtPollReply
//	              Unicast Transmit:   Not Allowed
//	              Broadcast Transmit: Not Allowed
//	MediaServer - Receive:            Reply by broadcasting ArtPollReply
//	              Unicast Transmit:   Not Allowed
//	              Broadcast Transmit: Not Allowed
